                    <h3>Desert Rally</h3>
                    <p>
                        Desert Rally is using Visual Programming to create kind of
                        Endless Game. I use Scratch for my first time learning
                        programming because it helps me to improve my logical thinking
                        of how to sequencing the codes and make it work with just the
                        codes provided. We can add Sprites as much as needed,
                        background, backsound, even we can draw it ourselves. Scratch
                        also provides additional extensions like translate or pen, even
                        Cloud Variables if you want to make multiplayer game.

                    <h3>Memory Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        Memory Game helps you to improve your ability to memorize
                        something with a fun way. This game created on Visual Studio
                        Code with Javascript game framework, called Phaser. It becomes
                        easier to create a game if you use framework because the code is
                        more readable, easy to use, and they provide many object and
                        clasess that ready to use. This Memory Game i have made has a
                        player to control with key arrows. The player have to check
                        every box to match it with others. It also has timer so you have
                        to match all the items inside the box before the time is over.
